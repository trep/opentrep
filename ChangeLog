* Sat Sep 28 2019 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.07.2
- Merged the trunk and releases branches to master, so as to get
a standard setup
- The default branch is now master
- The versionning scheme follows the one on the releases branch before,
i.e., the version number is incremented just before tagging
the Git repository

* Web Jan 16 2019 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.07.1
- Improved the release of Python libraries and scripts (e.g.,
following Fedora packaging guidelines, and it works well
with `pipenv`)

* Sun Oct 14 2018 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.07.0
- Support of several deployment stages (allowing staging new versions
before activating them in production when QA-cleared)
- Full support of MacOS
- Full revamping of the options for the
`opentrep-{indexer,dbmgr,searcher}` command-line programs,
supporting server-side deployments
- Full support of the new OpenTravelData data files, which also
reference non-IATA POR (points of reference). Hence, ICAO-
and UN/LOCODE-referenced POR may now be indexed

* Sun Jun 28 2015 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.06.6
- The Python libraries are now installed into standard directory

* Sun Apr 19 2015 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.06.5
- The POR reference data file has been renamed, from ORI
to OPTD (standing for Open Travel Data, i.e., the name of the
project maintaining that file). The new location is now
http://bit.ly/1FXmQdl and the file is named optd_por_public.csv.
- When only (IATA, ICAO) codes are used in the query string,
the POR are retrieved from the underlying database, when existing
(and from the classical free-text search when no database is
available).
- The US DOT World Area Code (WAC) has been added to the POR
reference data file, and is now retrieved by OpenTREP.

* Sun Apr 13 2014 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.06.1
Re-wrote the SQL database layer. A new program, namely
opentrep-dbmgr, can now create, update and query the SQL
database (which can be SQLite3 or MySQL/MariaDB).
There is still some work to do to use the SQL database
when only codes are detected within the search string.
- Issue #6 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/6):
	Many POR are also indexed with collateral types.
	For instance, air bases are also indexed as airports.
- Issue #7 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/7):
	The punctuation characters are removed. Note that,
	as the Unicode normalisation procedure is used,
	there is still an issue when called from Django
	(for reasons unknown yet).
- Issues #4 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/4)
	and #8 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/8):
	Fixed the ORI POR data file
	(http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd/refdata/ORI).					  

* Sun Feb 02 2014 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.06.0
- Issue #1 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/1):
The search algorithm is now modular.
- Issues #3 (https://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/3)
and #5 (https://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/5):
POR are now indexed with their associated PageRank value
(equal to 0.1% when there is no PageRank vallue).
- Latest ORI POR data:
http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd/blob/trunk/refdata/ORI/ori_por_public.csv

* Sun Feb 24 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.05.3
- Fixed a bug hindering the new slice and dice algorithm to fully work.
That latter now seems to fully work.

* Sat Feb 16 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.05.2
- The new slice and dice algorithm seems to work now. More thorough tests
are needed.

* Sat Feb 16 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.05.1
- Updated the source code to the newest format of the ORI-maintained list
of POR.
- Added the Geonames-derived feature names (e.g., "nce city" now returns
the POR for the city of Nice, France).

* Sun Oct 14 2012 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.05.0
- The search and indexation pieces of algorithm have been completely
revamped. Every multi-word string now gives birth to a new C++ structure,
namely StringPartition, made of all its partitions in an exhaustive
manner. All those string partitions are indexed by Xapian. And an
independant search is performed on every one of those string partitions;
a global match, made of the combination from several match-based
pieces of algorithm, is then assigned to every string partition;
the best matching string partition is then selected.
That new search algorithm allows, among other things, to combine several
independant matching methods, including heuristic ones.
- The MySQL database is no longer needed. The ORI-maintained list of POR
(points of reference) is now parsed, thanks to Boost.Spirit v2.
A copy of that file is kept under the data/por/ sub-directory.

* Sat Nov 12 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.04.1
- Added pragmas to have the code compatible with the new
Soci-3.1.0 version.
- Removed any reference to ExtraCC

* Tue Nov 01 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.04.0
- The build system is now based on CMake (instead of the GNU
Autotools).

* Sun Mar 29 2009 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.03.0
- Now relies on the new SOCI RPM.

* Sun Mar 22 2009 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.02.0
- RPM release for Fedora 10
